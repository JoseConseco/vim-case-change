INTRODUCTION                                                      *casechange*

Casechange is a plugin for rotating through different casing styles. It aims to
fix the behaviour of ~ in visual mode.

USAGE                                                       *casechange-usage*

Select the piece of text you want to apply CaseChange to and press ~

  helloWorld
  HelloWorld
  HELLO_WORLD
  hello_world
  hello-world

For example, if you wish to change the current word, you could press viw~ and
then keep pressing ~ until you get to the right case.

KEYMAPS                                                   *casechange-keymaps*

The only keymap that this plugin sets is ~, you can prevent this by setting:

let g:casechange_nomap = 1
